Between the years 1951 and 1974, the University of Pennsylvania, under the direction of world-famous dermatologist Albert Kligman, and sometimes alongside the direction of the [United States Army](https://www.thedp.com/article/1995/05/u-involved-in-chemical-tests-on-prisoners), funded a large-scale low-profile prison experimentation program. Klingman and his many technicians and residents conducted tests on prisoners living behind the bars of the now-defunct Holmesburg Prison in Philadelphia. Prisoners were paid to participate in experiments, some of which were seemingly benign, but others resulting in permanent damage to the subjects. The prisoners often recounted that they had little choice but to participate in the studies because they were desperate for money (for bail, legal fees, cigarettes etc.).

One thesis of Allen Hornblum’s recount of the Holmesburg experiments (in [his 1998 book *Acres of Skin*](https://www.amazon.com/Acres-Skin-Experiments-Holmesburg-Prison/dp/0415923360)) is this: Even the less harmful experiments were unethical because, by the very nature of the subjects being imprisoned, the prisoners had not been able to give informed consent to the experimental treatments they received, thus blatantly violating the Nuremberg Code of ethics established in the 1940s. (Holmesburg was not the first nor [most egregious](https://www.cdc.gov/tuskegee/index.html) violation of the Code on United States soil.)

The medical ethics violations at Holmesburg are seldom remembered, except of course in a few books and in the [stories passed down by prisoners](https://www.amazon.com/Sentenced-Science-Black-Imprisonment-America/dp/0271058757). As recently as April of this year, descendants like (former inmate) Leodus Jones’s daughter have [publicly called for reparations](https://merionwest.com/2021/04/06/penns-imprisoned-black-guinea-pigs-deserve-an-apology-and-reparations/) in the form of an official apology by the University and a generational educational stipend because, as she argues, the price of Kingman and the University of Pennsylvania’s sins has been paid over generations.

Despite founding an [esteemed center for medical ethics](https://lgbtc.vpul.upenn.edu/transresources/) and providing [anonymous grants to trans students](https://lgbtc.vpul.upenn.edu/transresources/), behind their newfound cultural veil of virtue signaling, the University of Pennsylvania--yet again blinded by utilitarian aims--continues to take advantage of human subjects who are *ipso facto* unable to give proper consent. University of Pennsylvania [announced on April 22nd](https://coronavirus.upenn.edu/announcement/update-penn's-plans-fall-semester) that all students, including graduate and professional students, would be required to be fully vaccinated by the Fall 2021 semester. More recently [on June 1st, the university announced](https://coronavirus.upenn.edu/announcement/message-faculty-staff-and-postdocs-vaccination-status-and-return-campus) the same for all faculty, staff, and post-doctoral trainees. In total, Penn will be subjecting it’s [26,552 students, 5,048 faculty and 2,125 academic support staff](https://www.upenn.edu/about/facts) to one of two mRNA vaccine regimens (Pfizer or Moderna), or the viral-vector-based Johnson & Johnson vaccine, [all of which are authorized for emergency use](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/learn-more-about-covid-19-vaccines-fda) but not approved by the FDA, making all treatments---strictly speaking---experimental. Penn is [by no means alone](https://www.bestcolleges.com/blog/list-of-colleges-that-require-covid-19-vaccine/) in its mandatory COVID-19 vaccine requirement. However, given its historical authority in the medical research community, its mandatory vaccination program ought to be viewed also in the context of its past medical ethics violations.

By the Fall of 2021, Penn’s campus will become, in the words of Kligman, like a “fertile field” for studying the COVID-19 vaccines. Students, for example, are offered a medical insurance plan that limits their ability to see providers outside of Student Health Services or infrequently the broader University of Pennsylvania healthcare system. Within the Penn system, medical scientists at Penn can study a fully-vaccinated population, a majority of which have received an mRNA vaccine, a technology also (in part) [invented by Penn faculty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_Weissman).

Some of the tactics used by Penn and Kligman at Holmesburg were carried on to their mandatory vaccine program. According to sources familiar with the matter, the paperwork for requesting a medical or religious exemption from the COVID-19 vaccine is carefully worded as to have grounds to deny any and every exemption request. Compare this to the [legalese prisoners signed](https://www.thedp.com/article/2007/11/swollen_feet_and_a_wanted_apology) before submitting to the experiments. Holmesburg prisoners were conditioned to rely on the income paid out by the Kingman experiments. Similarly, Penn students have invested small fortunes on tuition, either financed with student loans or accompanied with the *gravitas* of unrealistic expectations from parents, frequently both. On the other end of the spectrum, doctoral students (such as myself), though provided a generous stipend, are facing the opportunity cost of possibly having turned down industry jobs, as well as sacrificing many years of their youth to write a dissertation.

In so much as receiving the COVID-19 vaccine is legally consensual, for most members of the Penn community, the cost of saying no appears unreasonably high. The exact implications of noncompliance are hazy (unlike Rutgers who threatened to [cut off access to online courseware](https://coronavirus.rutgers.edu/a-message-to-students-on-covid-19-vaccinations/) for non-compliant students) , but so much is clear that unvaccinated students, faculty, and staff will be required to receive tests twice weekly. The lack in clarity of any more serious consequences of noncompliance is perhaps a passive form of intimidation, as is the implied social repercussions for the few brazen “antivaxers,” having been donned with the *black mark*. Indubitably, the University of Pennsylvania, is imposing a [moral status on being vaccinated](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6267229/). Any objection makes *you* the malfeasor.

To “jab or not to jab” ought to foremost be a personal and private medical decision, independent from Penn’s consensus medical opinion. For example, community members who have already gained natural immunity, having tested positive for the virus and subsequently testing positive for antibodies, may be (redundantly) required to receive two doses instead of one, despite evidence suggesting a second dose is [not beneficial](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2101667) to patients already infected. Troubling still are serious side effects such as [myocarditis](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/myocarditis.html) as well as of the prevalence of less serious side effects (i.e. fatigue, headache, chills, fever) that [occur rarely](https://www.samhealth.org/about-samaritan/news-search/2021/02/09/covid-19-vaccine-side-effects-compared-to-other-vaccines) in vaccines typically required by colleges and universities but are common from the COVID-19 vaccine; for those who were already infected, these “mild” side effects are highly [exacerbated](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2101667) still. Not to mention HHS Vaccine Adverse Reporting System data suggesting that COVID vaccines are by the most deadly vaccines in history. (Below is a bar graph of vaccine deaths by vaccine type, comparing other vaccines required by Penn, including the recent influenza and COVID-19 additions.)

Such concerns are laughable to university administrators. Just as [Holmesburg inmates like Eddie Anthony](https://www.amazon.com/Sentenced-Science-Black-Imprisonment-America/dp/0271058757) endured a "paternalistic relationship with single-minded researchers," administrators, despite good intentions, often exhibit a similar paternalistic worldview. Although, of course, we cannot rightly compare the egregiousness of what happened in Holmesburg with the mandatory vaccine program at Penn, there are undoubtedly innately human forces common to both.

## A little about my research

Although I am affiliated with the Electrical and Systems Engineering department at Penn, I consider myself neither an engineer nor a mathematician, but something in between. As a mathematician, I work in areas of applied category theory, algebraic combinatorics, and applied algebraic topology. As an engineer, I focus on application areas in multi-agent systems. In particular, I am interested in robotic systems, graph signal processing, and opinion dynamics. 

<!-- Of paramount importance to my research is a curious operator called the [**Tarski Laplacian**](https://hansriess.com/publication/2020-7-8-tarski-laplacian), inspired by the combinatorial Hodge Laplacian (maybe going back to De Rahm but formally introduced in a 1944 German-language journal by Beno Eckmann) which specializes to the (inner-product space) [sheaf Laplacian](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.01513.pdf) which in turn specializes to the ubiquitous graph Laplacian, known for its central place in spectral graph theory. The Tarski Laplacian acts on assignments of data to a so-called sheaf: an abstract mathematical object that collects data over networks. In particular, the Tarski Laplacian acts on data collected by (order) lattices (e.g. the lattice of subspaces of a vector space, lattice of subsets of a set) called *stalks* 'living above' the nodes of a network. -->

## Personal bio

I was born and raised in Bloomington, Indiana. I did my undergrad in Durham, North Carolina. I am now working on my doctorate in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. I enjoy playing tennis and biking. I enjoy listening and playing jazz and classical music. Above all, I enjoy spending time with my fianc√©e.

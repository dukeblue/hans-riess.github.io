I am a researcher working in applied algebra/combinatorics/topology focused on application areas in multi-agent systems. In particular, I am interested in robotic systems, graph signal processing, and opinion dynamics.

The critical mathematical tool in my research program is the **Tarski Laplacian**, an operator my advisor (Robert Ghrist) and I discovered that is analogous to the graph Laplacian and the combinatorial Hodge Laplacian (if you know what that is), but for **sheaves**---mathematical objects that collect assignments of data to geometric objects such as networks---taking data in **lattices**---ordered sets with an upper and lower merging operation called join  ($\vee$) and meet ($\wedge$).

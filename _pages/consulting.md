It's not uncommon in industry for data scientists, software engineers, systems engineers, quantitative analysts etc. to consult a mathematician in order to obtain a new perspective on their models. Some of the services I provide include:

* Hands-on software development/staff training/tutorials on Topological Data Analysis (TDA) for your data team.
* Advice/consultation pertaining to machine learning with network-structured data.
* Reading/editing/reviewing technical whitepapers.
* Whatever else you would like to use my expertise for.

 Please contact me at [hansriess4@gmail.com](mailto:hansriess4@gmail.com). I bill out by the hour, my rates starting at $100/hr. Due to the intense nature of my research and the COVID-19 pandemic, I am not able to provide quick turnover at this time.

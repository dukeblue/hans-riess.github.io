excerpt: 'In this paper we state the basics for a signal processing framework on quiver representations. A quiver is a directed graph and a quiver representation is an assignment of vector spaces to the nodes of the graph and of linear maps between the vector spaces associated to the nodes. Leveraging the tools from representation theory, we propose a signal processing framework that allows us to handle heterogeneous multidimensional information in networks. We provide a set of examples where this framework provides a natural set of tools to understand apparently hidden structure in information. We remark that the proposed framework states the basis for building graph neural networks where information can be processed and handled in alternative ways.'

In this paper we state the basics for a signal processing framework on quiver representations. A quiver is a directed graph and a quiver representation is an assignment of vector spaces to the nodes of the graph and of linear maps between the vector spaces associated to the nodes. Leveraging the tools from representation theory, we propose a signal processing framework that allows us to handle heterogeneous multidimensional information in networks. We provide a set of examples where this framework provides a natural set of tools to understand apparently hidden structure in information. We remark that the proposed framework states the basis for building graph neural networks where information can be processed and handled in alternative ways.

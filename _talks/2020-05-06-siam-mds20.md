[Abstract](https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_talk.cfm?p=108999)

I presented work on the Tarski Laplacian for the mini-symposium Topological Image Analysis organized by Aras Asad. In particular, I presented some preliminary ideas on processing images with lattice-based convolutional filters using the Tarski Laplacian of a certain sheaf over the grid-graph on an image.

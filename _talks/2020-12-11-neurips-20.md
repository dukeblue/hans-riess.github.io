Multiparameter persistent homology has been largely neglected as an input to machine learning algorithms. We consider the use of lattice-based convolutional neural network layers as a tool for the analysis of features arising from multiparameter persistence  modules. We find that these show promise as an alternative to convolutions for the classification of multidimensional persistence modules.

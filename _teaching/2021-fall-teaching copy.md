I was the teaching assistant for Video Production for Mathematics, an experimental course taught in the math deparment by my advisor Robert Ghrist. The course was in seminar format, usually consisting of software demos as well as Q&A. The focal point of the class was a final project in which students produced their own math videos.

My responsibilities consisted of

* Grading assignments where students demonstrate a specific video production skill they learned.
* Providing highly detailed feedback for the final project videos to the students.

### Student Projects

I am very proud of all my students. Here are some of the projects. (You can skip from one video to the next video with the forward button.)

We introduce a vast generalization of the graph Laplacian for certain systems of lattices over a network or even cell complex: a lattice-valued sheaf. Sheaves, an artifact of algebraic geometry, have recently found applications in sensing problems (R. Ghrist & S. Krishnan), signal processing (M. Robinson), distributed optimization (J. Hansen & R. Ghrist), persistent homology (J. Curry), and graph signal processing (J. Hansen). We extend the theory to lattices: discrete algebraic structures that encode hierarchical relationships. These structures have enough algebraic properties for effective message-passing algorithms and even constructions in homological algebra. The main result that drives our applications is a Hodge-theoretic fixed point theorem for a certain sheaf Laplacian which we call the Tarski Laplacian. This, then, is used to update the states of a sheaf in a distributed way to reach system consistency in a finite number of iterations (under mild assumptions). Time permitting, we will preview forthcoming work on applications to graph signal processing, and, in particular, to image processing in which convolutional filtering is derived from the Tarski Laplacian of a certain sheaf over the grid-graph of an image.']"

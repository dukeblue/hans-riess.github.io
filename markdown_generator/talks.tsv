A Lattice-Theoretic Laplacian for Cellular Sheaves	Talk	siam-cse21	SIAM Conference on Computational Science and Engineering	2021-03-01	Fort Worth, Texas		I presented work on the Tarski Laplacian for the mini-symposium Emerging Directions in Computational Topology organized by Brad Nelson and Greg Henselman. I discussed some computational challenges of computing global sections with the Tarski Laplacian.		
Cellular Sheaves and the Tarski Laplacian	Talk	abramsky	Quantum Group, Oxford Department of Computer Science	2020-07-31	Oxford, UK		"At the kind invitation of Vidit Nanda, I gave a talk to Samson Abramsky and his research group about our paper ""Cellular Sheaves of Lattices and the Tarski Laplacian."""		
A Novel Graph Laplacian for Lattice-Valued Sheaves	Talk	siam-mds20	SIAM Conference on Mathematics of Data Science	2020-05-06	Cincinnati, Ohio	https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_talk.cfm?p=108999	I presented work on the Tarski Laplacian for the mini-symposium Topological Image Analysis organized by Aras Asad. In particular, I presented some preliminary ideas on processing images with lattice-based convolutional filters using the Tarski Laplacian of a certain sheaf over the grid-graph on an image.		
Multidimensional Persistence Module Classification via Lattice-Theoretic Convolutions	Spotlight	neurips20	NeurIPS 2020 Worshop: Topological Data Analysis and Beyond	2020-12-11	Vancouver, Canada		Multiparameter persistent homology has been largely neglected as an input to machine learning algorithms. We consider the use of lattice-based convolutional neural network layers as a tool for the analysis of features arising from multiparameter persistence  modules. We find that these show promise as an alternative to convolutions for the classification of multidimensional persistence modules.	https://openreview.net/attachment?id=CqFcRp-_mUD&name=Poster	"<iframe src=""//player.crossminds.ai/index.html?vid=606fe4b3f43a7f2f827c0451&utm_medium=share&utm_source=embed"" scrolling=""no"" border=""0"" frameborder=""no"" framespacing=""0"" allowfullscreen=""true""></iframe>"
Network Sheaves Valued in Categories of Adjunctions and their Laplacians	Talk	act21	Applied Category Theory 2021	2021-07-12	Cambridge, UK	https://hansriess.com/files/adjunctions.pdf	We report past and ongoing efforts to compute (global) sections of cellular sheaves valued in categories of adjunctions. First, we discuss previous work on sheaves valued in the category of complete lattices and Galois connections. Then, we survey ongoing efforts to generalize the fixed point theorem (Theorem 1) to (i) the category of (sufficiently small) categories and adjunctions, and (ii) the category of ordered monoid -enriched categories and adjunctions.

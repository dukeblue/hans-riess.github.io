A Lattice-Theoretic Laplacian for Cellular Sheaves	Talk	siam-cse21	SIAM Conference on Computational Science and Engineering	2021-03-01	Fort Worth, Texas		I presented work on the Tarski Laplacian for the mini-symposium Emerging Directions in Computational Topology organized by Brad Nelson and Greg Henselman. I discussed some computational challenges of computing global sections with the Tarski Laplacian.	
Cellular Sheaves and the Tarski Laplacian	Talk	abramsky	Quantum Group, Oxford Department of Computer Science	2020-07-31	Oxford, UK		"At the kind invitation of Vidit Nanda, I gave a talk to Samson Abramsky and his research group about our paper ""Cellular Sheaves of Lattices and the Tarski Laplacian."""	
A Novel Graph Laplacian for Lattice-Valued Sheaves	Talk	siam-mds20	SIAM Conference on Mathematics of Data Science	2020-05-06	Cincinnati, Ohio	https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_talk.cfm?p=108999	I presented work on the Tarski Laplacian for the mini-symposium Topological Image Analysis organized by Aras Asad. In particular, I presented some preliminary ideas on processing images with lattice-based convolutional filters using the Tarski Laplacian of a certain sheaf over the grid-graph on an image.	
Multidimensional Persistence Module Classification via Lattice-Theoretic Convolutions	Spotlight	neurips20	NeurIPS 2020 Worshop: Topological Data Analysis and Beyond	2020-12-11	Vancouver, Canada		Multiparameter persistent homology has been largely neglected as an input to machine learning algorithms. We consider the use of lattice-based convolutional neural network layers as a tool for the analysis of features arising from multiparameter persistence  modules. We find that these show promise as an alternative to convolutions for the classification of multidimensional persistence modules.	https://openreview.net/attachment?id=CqFcRp-_mUD&name=Poster
